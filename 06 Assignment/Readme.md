# States Use

- Implement Dislike functionality to your react application.

- Add a button, clicking on which will reduce the value of the counter.

- The UI could look somewhat like this :
- inital value of state :
  ![prop](../06%20Assignment/images/initial.jpeg)
- updated value of state after 4 clicks :
  ![prop](../06%20Assignment/images/after.jpeg)
